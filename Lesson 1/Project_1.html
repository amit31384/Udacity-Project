    <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em> server </em>. The servers finds the appropriate HTML <br>
    document and sends  it  back to user computer where a <em>web browser</em> <br>
    interprets the page and displays it on user's screen. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onzTRvuOWSM">This video</a> does a <br>
